# Toka_LITE
This 0D tokamak design study calulator is developed by students of the CDT Fusion Engineering and is intended for university-scale, non-neutronic tokamak devices.  The code implements a simplified subset of the physics used in the UKAEA PROCESS systems code and is calibrated to the parameter ranges of university tokamaks.
